# Retail-analysis
Studying retailer sales pattern and implementing supervised and unsupervised methods to build an effective model predicting retailer class
This dataset(Case Study Data 1) contains around 10,000 rows of unique retailers and the amount of sales they have done for 12 brands. We have performed K-means clustering on the dataset to identify retailer segmentation. Also, after the creation of a feature called cluster class, we can presume it to be a dependent variable with 4 class labels and have saved the new dataset with dependent feature. The other dataset uploaded contains dependent feature(Casestudy final).
